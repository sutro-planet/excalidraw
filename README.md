# Excalidraw without firebase

This is a fork from the [excalidraw project](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) with changes inspired and partly taken from [Kilian Decaderincourt](https://gitlab.com/kiliandeca/excalidraw-fork) to enable support for rooms without using firebase.<br />


## Sutroplanet specific build

Build and push the `excalidraw` container with the `.env.sutroplanet` configurations:

```
docker build -t hanfa/excalidraw:sutroplanet-latest  . --target production
docker push hanfa/excalidraw:sutroplanet-latest
```

Sutroplanet Excalidraw instance is deployed at https://draw.sutroplanet.com/.

## Setup with docker

Please copy the .env.development.default or .env.production.default file to .env (or with environment without default at the end) and change it according to your needs, see [react-scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/).

### Development

```
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec excalidraw yarn install
docker-compose exec excalidraw yarn start
```

Hint: Collab mode requires a secure context (https). Localhost works as well, but not http over local network.
